Roles:

Derek Heidtke
	- server.C and headers.H files

Ryan Hill
	- client.C

======================================================
Test Cases:

code does not yet work, so test cases cannot be tested yet.

Architecture:

Header:
	The header contains declarations and definitions of the structures used to encapsulate the SBCP frame
	types of message and attribute. These are defined as bitfields. Also in this file are wrapper functions
	for filling in the members of these struct types (createMess() and createAtrr(), respectively); constant
	definitions of the frame types (for code readability); and functions to serialize and deserialize the
	packets so they can be sent over the sockets.

Server:

	the server uses the typical client accept() loop with one modification: the accept is enclosed inside 
	of a loop conditioned on the select() call. The select() multiplexes the file descriptors of all clients
	that attempt to connect. After each call to select() the server checks which file descriptor has data ready,
	then reads from the corresponding client. After this, the processing of the packet takes place, and the
	server acts appropriately, often times sending out packets of its own.

Client:
